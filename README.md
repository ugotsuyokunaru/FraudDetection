```

### 2. Feature Engineering Preprocess
Use the following command to generate two pickle file  
1. ./data/combine_120days.pkl  
2. ./data/combine_30days.pkl  

for two different models with the origin train.zip and test.zip.
```
python preprocess.py
```

### 3. Training and Predicting
Use the following command to train three models and write prediction to csv files  
1. ./submit/focal.csv  
2. ./submit/david.csv  
3. ./submit/diff.csv  

before ensembling.  
```
python train.py
```

### 4. Ensembling
Use the following command to ensemble the above three models' prediction output files.
```
python ensemble.py
```
